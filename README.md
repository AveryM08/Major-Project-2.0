Hello! Once again, thank you for the extension that reduced a lot of stress and allowed us to produce a game that we are both truly proud of. Please enjoy our game!

Sewer Savior is a game that follows you, a rat, as you travel throughout the underground tunnels, defeating enemies on your quest to defeat the large and mysterious evil creature that has been wreaking havoc on your community. No rat has gone on this mission and returned... yet. Do you have what it takes to restore peace and save the rats?

Some important notes for the game:
- WASD or arrow keys for movement controls, spacebar to jump, and x to attack.
- Your two main enemies are rats that used to be like you, but now carry diseases that harm you just by contact, and frogs. The frogs are perfectly fine, and although their tongues might be in your way, they're innocent so you can't attack them!
- You get back up to full health for each level, and your carry your coins unless you die. If you get 15 coins, it automatically gives you one more health (heart).
- The third level you have a propeller attached to you, this is to navigate this area of the dangerous sewers better. It's so difficult to steer and control, that you are not able to attack within this level (by design).

Best of luck, fair adventurer!
